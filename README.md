### Hey there.

I consider myself a programming hobbyist. I enjoy fiddling with the back-end, mainly with Python and Pytest, trying to mix in some TDD.
Also, I'm in a thrill to learn Golang, which I'm enjoying a lot :)

Some unnecessary (but cool) info about me:
- I'm an avid gamer. But also managed to fit in programming into my hobbies.
- I like Java. A lot.
- I'm trying to learn Rust for some time now.
- I enjoy Linux and Vim, though I use Windows for gaming purposes (hypocrisy?). Not quite a pro Vimmer yet.
- I've worked both with QA and development, being flexible in terms of which side I choose to work.
- I'm always open to learn new things.
